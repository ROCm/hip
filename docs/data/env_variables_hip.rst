      - Unset by default.
      - 0,1,2: Depending on the number of devices on the system.

    * - | ``GPU_DUMP_CODE_OBJECT``
        | Dump code object.

        | The maximum number of hardware queues allocated per device.
      - ``4``
      - | The recommended maximum value for this setting is 4.
        | The variable controls how many independent hardware queues HIP runtime can create per process,
        | per device. If an application allocates more HIP streams than this number, then HIP runtime reuses
        | the same hardware queues for the new streams in a round-robin manner. Note: this limit excludes
        | hardware queues created for CU-masked HIP streams and cooperative queues for HIP Cooperative
        | Groups (one per device). Setting this value above 4 may result in unpredictable performance.
