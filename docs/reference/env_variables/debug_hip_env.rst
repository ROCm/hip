The debugging environment variables in HIP are collected in the following table. For
more information, check :doc:`hip:how-to/logging`, :doc:`hip:how-to/debugging`
and :doc:`GPU isolation <rocm:conceptual/gpu-isolation>`.

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Default value**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``AMD_LOG_LEVEL``
        | Enables HIP log on various level.
      - ``0``
      - | 0: Disable log.
        | 1: Enables error logs.
        | 2: Enables warning logs next to lower-level logs.
        | 3: Enables information logs next to lower-level logs.
        | 4: Enables debug logs next to lower-level logs.
        | 5: Enables debug extra logs next to lower-level logs.

    * - | ``AMD_LOG_LEVEL_FILE``
        | Sets output file for ``AMD_LOG_LEVEL``.
      - stderr output
      -

    * - | ``AMD_LOG_MASK``
        | Specifies HIP log filters. Here is the `complete list of log masks <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/blob/develop/projects/clr/rocclr/utils/debug.hpp#L48>`_.
      - ``0x7FFFFFFF``
      - | 0x1: Log API calls.
        | 0x2: Kernel and copy commands and barriers.
        | 0x4: Synchronization and waiting for commands to finish.
        | 0x8: Decode and display AQL packets.
        | 0x10: Queue commands and queue contents.
        | 0x20: Signal creation, allocation, pool.
        | 0x40: Locks and thread-safety code.
        | 0x80: Kernel creations and arguments, etc.
        | 0x100: Copy debug.
        | 0x200: Detailed copy debug.
        | 0x400: Resource allocation, performance-impacting events.
        | 0x800: Initialization and shutdown.
        | 0x1000: Misc debug, not yet classified.
        | 0x2000: Show raw bytes of AQL packet.
        | 0x4000: Show code creation debug.
        | 0x8000: More detailed command info, including barrier commands.
        | 0x10000: Log message location.
        | 0x20000: Memory allocation.
        | 0x40000: Memory pool allocation, including memory in graphs.
        | 0x80000: Timestamp details.
        | 0x100000: Comgr path information print.
        | 0xFFFFFFFF: Log always even mask flag is zero.

    * - | ``HIP_FORCE_DEV_KERNARG``
        | Forces kernel arguments to be stored in device memory to reduce latency.
        | Can improve performance by 2-3 µs for some kernels.
      - ``1``
      - | 0: Disable
        | 1: Enable

    * - | ``HIP_LAUNCH_BLOCKING``
        | Used for serialization on kernel execution.
      - ``0``
      - | 0: Disable. Kernel executes normally.
        | 1: Enable. Serializes kernel enqueue, behaves the same as ``AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL``.

    * - | ``HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES``
        | Only devices whose index is present in the sequence are visible to HIP
      - Unset by default.
      - 0,1,2: Depending on the number of devices on the system.

    * - | ``GPU_DUMP_CODE_OBJECT``
        | Dump code object.
      - ``0``
      - | 0: Disable
        | 1: Enable

    * - | ``AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL``
        | Serialize kernel enqueue.
      - ``0``
      - | 0: Disable
        | 1: Wait for completion before enqueue.
        | 2: Wait for completion after enqueue.
        | 3: Both

    * - | ``AMD_SERIALIZE_COPY``
        | Serialize copies
      - ``0``
      - | 0: Disable
        | 1: Wait for completion before enqueue.
        | 2: Wait for completion after enqueue.
        | 3: Both

    * - | ``GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES``
        | The maximum number of hardware queues allocated per device.
      - ``4``
      - | The recommended maximum value for this setting is 4.
        | The variable controls how many independent hardware queues HIP runtime can create per process,
        | per device. If an application allocates more HIP streams than this number, then HIP runtime reuses
        | the same hardware queues for the new streams in a round-robin manner. Note: this limit excludes
        | hardware queues created for CU-masked HIP streams and cooperative queues for HIP Cooperative
        | Groups (one per device). Setting this value above 4 may result in unpredictable performance.
